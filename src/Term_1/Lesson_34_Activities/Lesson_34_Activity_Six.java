 * Lesson 34 Coding Activity 6
 * 
 * For the Lesson 34 activities, you will be asked to write one or more methods.
 * Use the template to write a main method that tests each of your methods, 
 * then paste everything into the code runner box. Your submission should 
 * begin with the first import statement and end with the final }.
 * 
 * Write a method that takes an array of ints and returns true if all 
 * of the values in the array are positive. If the array contains any
 * negative integers, it should return false.
